# MapServer map file uses the pound sign (#) to denote the start of a line
# comment--each line that needs to be commented has to be prepended with a "#".
#
# Map files begin with MAP keyword to signify the start of the map object.
# Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclosed between MAP and END
# at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other
# objects.

  # The projection object is typically used within the map and the layer
  # objects. You only define it once within the map object and this definition
  # becomes your output projection--MapServer will render your maps in this
  # projection.  You also use the projection object within the layer object to 
  # define your input projection.  Your layers can be in different
  # projections--MapServer will reproject them into your output projection.  
  # If no projection is defined within the layer object, MapServer assumes 
  # your input projection is the same as your output projection.  This is not 
  # a required object unless you're creating a map file that supports one of 
  # the OGC interoperability web services specifications (WMS/WFS/WCS).

    #  "lat_0=45"
